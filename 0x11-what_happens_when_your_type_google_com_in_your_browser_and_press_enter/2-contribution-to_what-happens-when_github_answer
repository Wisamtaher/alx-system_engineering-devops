Detailed Explanation of the Request Process When Entering https://www.google.com
1. DNS Resolution
When you enter https://www.google.com in your browser and press Enter, the first step is to resolve the domain name into an IP address. This involves several steps:

Browser Cache: The browser first checks its cache for a DNS record.
Operating System Cache: If not found, it queries the operating system's cache.
Router Cache: Next, it checks the router's cache.
ISP DNS Server: If the record is still not found, the request is sent to the ISP's DNS server.
Recursive DNS Lookup: The ISP's DNS server may need to perform a recursive lookup, querying multiple DNS servers to find the IP address associated with www.google.com.
2. Connecting to the Server
Once the IP address is obtained, the browser establishes a connection to the server:

Firewall: The request passes through a firewall, which ensures only safe traffic reaches the server.
Load Balancer: The request hits a load balancer, which distributes incoming traffic across multiple servers to ensure availability and reliability.
Web Server: The load balancer forwards the request to one of the web servers.
3. HTTPS and Encryption
The connection is secured using HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure):

SSL/TLS Handshake: The browser and server perform an SSL/TLS handshake to establish an encrypted connection.
Data Encryption: All data sent between the browser and server is encrypted, protecting it from eavesdroppers.
4. Processing the Request
The web server processes the incoming request:

Application Server: The web server forwards the request to an application server.
Database Query: The application server may need to query a database to generate the web page.
Response Generation: The application server generates the HTML for the requested page and sends it back to the web server.
5. Returning the Response
The web server sends the generated HTML back to the browser through the same secure, encrypted connection:

Load Balancer: The response passes through the load balancer.
Firewall: It then passes through the firewall.
Browser: Finally, the browser receives the HTML, parses it, and renders the web page.
